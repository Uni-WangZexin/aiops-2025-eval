Given the call chain (`frontend -> adservice`), the root cause likely stems from `adservice-0` itself (e.g., a JVM thread leak or infinite loop) rather than propagation, as no downstream services are implicated. The node CPU rise is secondary, caused by the pod's excessive load. No other services show abnormal restarts or CPU spikes, ruling out cascading failures. Focus on `adservice-0`'s JVM configuration or application logic."
